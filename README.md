# secure_check_police_logs
This is my first project the project name is "SecureCheck: A Python-SQL Digital Ledger for Police Post Logs"
,im very excited to explore it very intresting.initially i got data set after that using jyternotebook for cleaned dataset some missing and nan value datas.
After that create connect db to sql,and then create table with queries foe police ledger E_Comm based records maintaining and view to createted table in db.
Useing vscode for create Dashboard to see advanced insight button and create some queries and explore it ,really im surpried for showing Dashboard in outputs
